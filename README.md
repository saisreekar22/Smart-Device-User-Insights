# Smart-Device-User-Insights

This is a freelance project I did for a startup that sells Air Purifiers and Air Quality Monitors. They wanted me to analyze their device usage data and find patterns in the smart device usage. The key problems they had were that users were not turning the devices on and off properly, according to the pollution trends. I analyzed 1 month's data and gave them solutions to improve their usage.
